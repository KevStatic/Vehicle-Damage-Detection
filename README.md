# Vehicle-Damage-Detection
A robust Vehicle Damage Detection model by combining multiple datasets is a strong approach for improving generalization and performance

## 📌 Problem Statement

Develop a Vehicle Damage Detection system using deep learning that can automatically detect and localize damages on vehicles. The system should identify which car component is damaged (e.g., bumper, headlight, door) and classify the type of damage (e.g., dent, scratch, broken part).
